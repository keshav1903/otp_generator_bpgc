PROJECT DESCRIPTION: When some fest/merch comes, whole PR team make their full efforts to convince other to buy pass/merch. Sometimes they do fake signatures of students who do not consent to deduct their money from SWD.
They provide google forms but they also come to everyone's room to sign to give them permission.
This project is mainly to avoid this signature-system and replace it with OTP system.
